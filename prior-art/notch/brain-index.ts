/**
 * Retrieval — finding the memories a turn is actually about.
 *
 * Two channels, unioned:
 *
 *   entities — exact matches on the literal strings a codebase is made of:
 *              src/core/git.ts, AgentBase, EADDRINUSE, #42. High precision,
 *              zero cost, and available because our domain's entities are
 *              strings that appear verbatim rather than noun phrases someone
 *              has to infer.
 *   BM25     — ordinary lexical scoring over the lemmatised text, for the
 *              memories nobody thought to tag.
 *
 * The union is the whole point, and it's where this consciously parts company
 * with the reference. mem0 builds its candidate set from the dense results only
 * (`main.py:1622`) and then lets BM25 and entity boosts re-rank *within* it —
 * so a memory BM25 matches perfectly but vector search missed is unreachable at
 * any score. That isn't hybrid retrieval, it's dense recall wearing a hybrid
 * costume. With no dense channel at all, our recall IS entities ∪ BM25; if
 * either finds something, it's a candidate.
 *
 * Two more things worth taking from mem0, and two worth refusing:
 *
 *   take:   memory_count_weight (`main.py:1758`) — an inverse-quadratic IDF
 *           surrogate. An entity linked to one memory weighs 1.0; to a hundred,
 *           0.09. Common entities suppress themselves. Ten lines, no corpus
 *           statistics, no tuning.
 *   take:   over-fetch before the cut, so scoring has room to reorder.
 *   refuse: its query-dependent divisor (`scoring.py:97`), which makes a score
 *           mean different things in different queries — a memory scoring 0.9 on
 *           semantics alone drops to 0.45 the moment some *other* memory in the
 *           same query happens to match a keyword. Ours is fixed.
 *   refuse: filtering expiry after the top-k cut (`main.py:1626`), where dead
 *           rows silently eat the recall budget. Ours are gone before we rank.
